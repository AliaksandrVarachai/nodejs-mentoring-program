# Task 1.2

## Requirements

Write a program which should do the following:
- Read the content of csvfile from `./csv` directory. Example: https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex1.
- Use the *csvtojsonpackage* (https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson) to convert *csv* file to *json* object.
- Write the *csv* file content to a new *txt* file. Use the following format: https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex2.
- Do not load all the content of the *csv* file into RAM via stream (read/write file content line by line).
- In case of read/write errors, log them in the console.
- The program should be started via *npm script* using *nodemon* (i.e. `npm run task2`).
